# The Server Must Scale
This is our entry into the 2024 GMTK Game Jam where the theme was "Built to Scale". 
We interpreted the theme as "scaling upwards" which is a term in software development 
where you design programs to be able to handle a large quantity of data and we 
thought it would be interesting to represent this as a game where you build a server 
farm that has to handle a increasingly large amount of data being input. 
Therefore, you are building a server to scale upwards and be as efficient as possible. 
Enjoy!
